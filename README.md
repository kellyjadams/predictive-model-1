# predictive-model-1

The Python script I used to train and deploy my first predictive model to predict customer churn rate. 

Files
- [load_data.py](load_data.py) - The code I used to extract the data to load into the model. 
- [train_model.py](train_model.py) - The code I used to train the model.
- [deploy.py](deploy.py) - Use the model on my own machine.

Notes
While the code is similar to what I used, database/table names and query structure have been changed to protect private information.
